A female officer of the Buenos Aires City Police died after she was shot at by at least one person at the Retiro station on the C line, when a passenger stole her service weapon and was later arrested. According to police sources confirmed to NA, the incident occurred on Tuesday morning when an underground passenger got off at Retiro station and got into an argument with an employee of EMOVA (the Buenos Aires underground concessionaire). It was then that officer Analía Salazar interceded in the argument and the man who had got off the underground pulled out his service weapon and started shooting. Two of the bullets hit the officer, one in the thorax and the other in the neck; and another of the shots hit an underground worker in the waist. The officer was rushed by helicopter to the Churruca Hospital where she was to undergo surgery. Meanwhile, the 30-year-old man was arrested in front of the Sheraton Hotel after trying to escape and discarding the weapon on the stairs of the underground. The detainee reportedly has a criminal record for gender violence from 2021 and for resisting arrest from 2020. Officer Salazar worked on the C, D, E, H and Premetro lines. The underground service was interrupted, according to EMOVA, concessionaire of the Buenos Aires Subway, and the circulation of cars in the area is also cut off.
