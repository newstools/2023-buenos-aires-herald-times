Chinese automaker Chery Inc.'s plans to build a US$400-million electric vehicle and battery plant in Argentina underscore the country's intention to turn vast lithium deposits into an employment and investment bonanza. The Argentine government's announcement comes amid a frantic race for Andean lithium supplies as the transition from fossil fuels to cleaner energy opens a new front in the global tug-of-war between China and the United States. Against all odds, leaders in Argentina insist that lithium will not become another resource curse for a continent with a centuries-long history of exploiting raw material reserves. Argentina and neighbouring lithium-rich Chile have begun talks with Brazil, a powerhouse in automobile manufacturing, to create a joint industry based on this metal for batteries. by Jonathan Gilbert, Bloomberg
