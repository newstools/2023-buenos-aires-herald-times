China is no longer the most populous country on the planet. The Asian giant has been overtaken by India, with a population of 1.417 billion. China currently has 1,412 million inhabitants, five million less than India, according to the 2022 World Population Review (World Popular Review). Some data indicates that India actually has even more people. It could be 1.423 billion. China ended the year with a decline in its population. This is the country's first population decline in 60 years, since 1961, according to data from the Asian nation's National Bureau of Statistics (NSO). The population increase represents an economic leap for India, as half of the population is under 30 years of age. This forces the country to create jobs as a matter of urgency, though unemployment rates hit their highest numbers since the pandemic in December.  The population gap will widen in the near future. According to United Nations forecasts, the population gap between India and China will continue to widen. By 2050, India's population could reach 1.688 billion people. China could see a marked decline to 1.317 billion people. That would reduce its current population by almost 100 million people. The UN has also pointed out that global population growth between 2022 and 2050 will occur in just eight countries: Congo, Egypt, Ethiopia, India, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Philippines and Tanzania.  –– TIMES/Perfil
