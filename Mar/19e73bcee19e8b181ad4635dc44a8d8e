Germany's All Quiet on the Western Front won the Oscar for Best International Feature Film from the US Academy of Motion Picture Awards, beating out local favorite Argentina, 1985 as well as Poland's Eo, Belgium's Close and Ireland's The Quiet Girl. With nine nominations from the Academy –– including one for the coveted Best Picture –– the German war epic was primed for success at the Dolby Theatre. Nevertheless, Argentina, 1985 didn’t walk away from the awards season empty handed. The film was awarded the Golden Globe for Best Non-English Language Film in January and the Goya award for best Ibero-American film in February. Nationally, the film garnered huge audiences and was the highest-grossing film of the year in cinemas. Paris Saint-Germain star and national team skipper Lionel Messi even showed his support, taking to social media in February to join his compatriots' campaign for the film to win the Oscar. "What a great film, '1985,' with [actor] Ricardo Darín and nominated for an Oscar. Let's go for the third," Messi wrote on Instagram. Director Santiago Mire’s drama, which details the efforts of prosecutors to put the leaders of the brutal 1976-1983 military dictatorship on trial for their crimes against humanity, was just one of five selected in the category from a pool of 70 films from all over the world. The last time an Argentine feature film was nominated in the Best International Film category was Damián Szifrón's Relatos Salvajes (“Wild Tales”) which lost in 2014 to the Polish film Ida. Argentina has won two Academy Awards in 1985 for La historia oficial ("The Official Story") and in 2009 for El secreto de sus ojos ("The Secret in Their Eyes").  –– TIMES
