United Nations human rights experts on Monday expressed concern about reports of repression, arbitrary killings, arrests and detentions in Peru and called on the country's authorities to create dialogue to end the crisis. "Serious allegations of excessive use of force by security forces and the failure of the government to create an environment conducive to dialogue are of grave concern," they said in a statement. Although mandated by the UN Human Rights Council, these rapporteurs are independent, voluntary experts who do not speak on behalf of the United Nations. On December 7, 2022, the Peruvian Congress voted to impeach the then-president Pedro Castillo on charges of attempting to dissolve Congress. Castillo was arrested and remained in custody on charges of rebellion and conspiracy. He was replaced by Dina Boluarte, former vice-president, who was sworn in as head of state. Castillo's fall after 17 months in power sparked violent protests that have so far left nearly 50 people dead and more than 600 injured in clashes with security forces. Demonstrators demand Boluarte's resignation, the closure of Congress and an early election in 2023. "In any democratic society, people have the right to protest and raise their concerns about political changes that affect their lives and livelihoods," the UN experts said. "Peruvian democracy faces a credibility crisis that can only be resolved through genuine dialogue, involving the people and taking into account their aspirations for reform," they added. The experts also expressed concern about reports of violence against journalists and media workers covering the protests and reiterated the State's obligation to carry out thorough investigations.  –– TIMES/AFP
