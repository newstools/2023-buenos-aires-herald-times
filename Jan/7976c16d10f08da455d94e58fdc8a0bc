Big-spending Chelsea are scrambling to sign Enzo Fernández in the final hours of the January transfer window in a deal that could be worth a record £115 million. Graham Potter's Chelsea have gone on a staggering spending spree this month, bringing in seven players so far including Mykhaylo Mudryk, Benoit Badiashile, Noni Madueke and Joao Felix, who joined on loan from Atlético Madrid. But they could smash the British transfer record to sign Argentina's World Cup winning midfielder Fernández from Benfica if they get the deal over the line in time. Reports say Chelsea club officials are in Lisbon to complete the deal. Fernández was left out of Benfica's matchday squad for their Primeira Liga fixture on Tuesday. The deadline in England is 2300 GMT. Should the ex-River Plate star complete his move, he would become the most expensive Argentine player of all time and the most expensive incoming British transfer. The previous British transfer record was set by Manchester City with the signing of Jack Grealish from Aston Villa for £100 million ($123 million) in August 2021. The deal would mark a massive profit for Benfica, who signed him from River last summer for just 10 million euros. The Millonario could also be up for a windfall – they reportedly are due a percentage of Enzo's next transfer. Premier League clubs have once again massively outspent their rivals across Europe in the desperate scramble to strengthen their squads for the second half of the season.  – TIMES/AFP
