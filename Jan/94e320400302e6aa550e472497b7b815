Argentina has a population of 46,044,703 people, according to fresh data from last year's national census. The figure, released by the INDEC national statistics bureau on Tuesday, is a significant rise on the 40.1 million people identified in the 2010 edition of the once-in-a-decade survey, the last taken. It is also 1.2 million inhabitants lower than the provisional results issued by the body last May. According to INDEC, 51.76 percent of Argentina’s population is female, while 48.22 percent are male. A total of 0.02 percent said they did not identify with either gender. In addition, the agency confirmed that information was collected from 17,780,210 private dwellings and 25,501 shared dwellings across the country. Results from the National Census of Populations, Homes and Households 2022 shows that Buenos Aires Province remains the most-populous region in the country, with a total of 17,569,053 inhabitants, including the heavily populated Conurbano. In second place was Córdoba Province (with 3,978,984 people), followed by Santa Fe Province (3,556,522 people), Buenos Aires City (3,120,612) and Mendoza Province (2,014,533). At the other end of the scale, the least populated province is Tierra del Fuego, a district that also includes Antarctica and the South Atlantic islands, with 190,641 inhabitants.  Fresh data This is INDEC’s second report with provisional data. The new population figure, with more than 46 million people, represents an increase of 5,927,607 people from the previous census, which was conducted in 2010. Speaking at a press conference presenting the updated statistics, INDEC chief Marco Lavagna said that citizen participation in the event had “exceeded expectations.” This was the first national census to include a digital aspect, with citizens and residents asked to go online and register their details in advance of the event. Lavagna said the online database had been vital in ensuring that members of the same family group were not duplicated in the final figure. He revealed that 65 percent of respondents had used mobile phones to enter their data, while 35 percent had used a computer.  – TIMES/NA
