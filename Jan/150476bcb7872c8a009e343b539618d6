Peru's Congress postponed until Tuesday afternoon the session to vote on whether to move up general elections to this year, amid growing protests calling for the resignation of President Dina Boluarte. With the country waiting nervously for decision by parliament, the plenary session convened for 11:00 local time (16:00 GMT) "will resume at 4:00 pm (21:00 GMT)," the Congress announced on social networks, in a sign that they have not yet reached a consensus to find a political formula to remedy the serious social crisis in the country. Boluarte and the right-wing Fujimori party Fuerza Popular are advocating for moving up elections to this year, which could be held next October or December instead of April 2024, as set by parliament in December. While protests are increasing in southern cities, in Lima, a group of Peruvian National Police (PNP) officers took up positions at the entry points to Jorge Chávez International Airport in the face of a demonstration that was taking place very close to the air terminal. Dozens of Aymara people marched demanding the resignation of the president in the Andean city of Juliaca, in the southern region of Puno (1,350 km from Lima). The rural peoples marched through the streets of Juliaca, where 18 people died on 9 January in clashes with the forces of law and order, shouting "the people united will never be defeated." The political powers are unable to find an adequate response to the demands of the population, especially the rural population of the historically neglected Andean south, which had hoped to improve its living conditions with the arrival of the leftist Pedro Castillo to the presidency (2021-2022), who was ousted and arrested on December 7 after attempting to dissolve Congress.  –– TIMES /AFP
