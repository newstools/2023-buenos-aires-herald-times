Two more people have been arrested in Colombia on suspicion of involvement in the murder of Paraguayan anti-mafia prosecutor Marcelo Pecci, the attorney general's office said on Sunday. Their arrests bring to eight the number of people detained in connection with the hit on May 10, 2022. "These two people were apparently responsible for... logistics" of the murder in Colombia, Attorney General Francisco Barbosa told journalists. Pecci was in Colombia with his wife on their honeymoon when he was gunned down on the island of Barú, near the tourist port of Cartagena on the Caribbean coast. Pecci was a prosecutor specializing in organised crime, drug-trafficking, money-laundering and terrorist-financing. Barbosa said the two detainees "coordinated the execution of the crime and met with people directly involved in this event." Colombian, Paraguayan and US authorities are searching for the masterminds of the assassination, who they say are linked to drug-trafficking networks. The United States has offered a US$5-million reward for information on his killing. Four of the eight people arrested so far, including the hitman, pleaded guilty and were sentenced to 23 years in prison in June.  –– AFP
