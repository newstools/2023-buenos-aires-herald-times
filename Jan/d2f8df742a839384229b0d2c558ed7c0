Seven people were killed, including a three-year-old boy from Argentina, and approximately 20 others injured early Tuesday morning in a fatal bus accident in Brazil. The accident occurred at around 1.50 am, when the bus travelling from the city of Florianopolis (Santa Catarina) to Foz do Iguaçu (Paraná) fell into a ravine on the side of the road for unknown reasons, Brazil's Federal Highway Police (PRF) said in a statement reported by local media. Several foreigners were onboard the vehicle when the crash took place. Among those killed were a three-year-old boy and his mother, both Argentine nationals, along with a woman and four men, according to police sources. Among the 54 passengers, there were also Paraguayans, French and Germans, according to a local fire chief of the Paraná municipality of Irati, Carla Spak. In total, 22 were injured and were taken to various hospitals and clinics in the region. The nationality of the other victims and the severity of their injuries is not known at the time of writing. Images released by the police show the bus overturned on the side of the BR-277 road, making rescue efforts exceptionally difficult. On Monday, another bus accident involving a youth football team left four dead, including three teenagers aged 14 to 17, and 29 injured in the southwest Brazilian state of Minas Gerais.  –– TIMES/AFP
