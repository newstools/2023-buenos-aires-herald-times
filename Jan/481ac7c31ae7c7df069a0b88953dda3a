A month on from lifting the World Cup in Qatar 2022, Argentina star Lionel Messi still can’t believe it. The diminutive number 10 posted a message on social media on Wednesday to celebrate La Albiceleste's third World Cup title and thank the fans. "I still can't believe it. What a beautiful madness we lived during all that time [the last month] and we ended up lifting the Cup that we all wanted so much," the national team skipper said on his Instagram account. He said that "being champions makes everything more beautiful, but what a beautiful month I spent, how many beautiful memories I have and miss," referring to the team’s experience in Qatar with the team led by coach Lionel Scaloni. "I miss my team-mates, the day-to-day with them, the mates, the chats, the training sessions, the boludeces [“jokes”] we used to make...", added 'La Pulga.' Messi also saved a special mention for his family whom he saw "enjoying an unforgettable experience," as well as "seeing the madness of the people on the pitch and in Argentina" – an allusion to Albiceleste’s fans, who are a candidate for FIFA's "best fans of 2022" award. The PSG star accompanied the post with images of the final against France, the trophy ceremony and celebrations back home in Buenos Aires. An estimated 50,000 Argentines travelled to Qatar, while more than five million people took to the streets to welcome the national team back home in an unprecedented celebration. "Thank you God for so much. As I said, I knew you were going to give it to me … We've been WORLD CHAMPIONS for a month now!!!" concluded the PSG star.  – TIMES/AFP
