Argentina's economy contracted for the third consecutive month in November as the government seeks to boost trade with Brazil and revive growth in the face of a drought that could hurt agricultural exports this year. The economy accumulated 5.9 percent growth between January and November 2022 compared to the same period in 2021, the INDEC national statistics bureau said Tuesday. The bureau’s Monthly Estimate of Economic Activity – which anticipates the country’s gross domestic product –  registered a 2.6 percent year-on-year rebound in November from the same month the previous year but a 0.7 percent decrease compared to October, according to the report. Both those figures undershoot analysts’ forecasts. Hotels and restaurants reported the highest year-on-year expansion last November, improving 22.1 percent, the data showed. The International Monetary Fund forecasts that Argentina’s economy recorded four percent growth last year, a figure that it predicts will halve to two percent in 2023. The latest figures come as Argentina and Brazil, the country's biggest trading partner, unveiled plans to boost trade ties through a programme to finance Argentine importers and a long-cherished idea of a common currency to replace the dollar in bilateral trade. Argentina is also facing a severe drought that threatens to dampen agricultural production in the grain-producing Pampas region this year, further damaging the nation's growth prospects.  – TIMES/BLOOMBERG/AFP
