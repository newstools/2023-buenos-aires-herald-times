Disenchantment is growing among wage earners in Argentina, according to a new survey. In fact, workers in the country are the most dissatisfied in the region. According to a new survey by the Bumeran job portal, almost 7 out of 10 wage earners in Argentina are not satisfied with their jobs. This figure is both the highest in the region and a substantial rise on that recorded in previous editions of the same study. When asked 'Are you happy with your job?', 67 percent of those surveyed in Argentina said no, compared to a regional average of 56 percent. Breaking it down by country, 40 percent in Peru answered in the negative, with 57 percent in Ecuador, 60 percent in Chile and 66 percent in Panama. "Sixty-seven percent of Argentines who participated in the study [this year] are not satisfied with their jobs. In 2021, 64 percent were dissatisfied. In 2020, 66 percent responded in this way," said Federico Barni, CEO of Jobint. He added: "In another study conducted in 2022, we asked them if they wanted to quit their job: seventy-one per cent said yes. Without a doubt, the pandemic has brought about irreversible changes in the world of work: today people want to work at what enjoy doing." According to the poll, 61 percent of Argentines surveyed are also unhappy with their pay. The same is true for 55 percent of Panamanians, 58% of Ecuadoreans, 58 percent of Peruvians, and 65 percent of Chileans. Compared to data from previous editions, pay dissatisfaction in Argentina has decreased. Seventy per cent were dissatisfied with their pay in 2021, and 63 percent in 2020. "In 2022, we conducted a study that showed that, at 632 MEP dollars per month, the average Argentine salary is the lowest in the region. It is not surprising, then, that Argentines want higher wage increases than the rest of the countries," explained Barni. More than 8,000 people participated in the survey, with more than 1,600 taking part from Argentina.  – TIMES/PERFIL
